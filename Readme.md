# Dyson Sphere Program Mods

You will find the source code of my mod(s) in the corresponding folders.<br>
For me this is the first time writing C# code and also the first time writing mods for games.<br>

I do this for fun and because i find it very interesting to fiddle with the topic.<br>
But when you use this keep in mind that mods for DSP are still unofficial and so they should not be used<br>
without having a backup of your save game files.

Reading the code of others was a very good way for me to get the idea of how things work, so i put mine here too.
